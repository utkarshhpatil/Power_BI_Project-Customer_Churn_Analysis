# Power_BI_Project-Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn rates for a telecom service provider using Power BI for data visualization and analysis.  
We identify key factors that contribute to churn, such as account length, local and international calls, and minutes.  
This information can be used to develop strategies to reduce churn and retain customers.
